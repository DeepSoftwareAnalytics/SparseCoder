# SparseCoder

This repo will provide the code for reproducing the experiments inÂ SparseCoder: Identifier-Aware Sparse Transformer for File-Level Code Summarization. 

SparseCoder employs a sliding window mechanism for self-attention to model short-term dependencies and leverages the structure of code to capture long-term dependencies among source code identifiers.


## Dependency
-pip install torch

-pip install transformers
